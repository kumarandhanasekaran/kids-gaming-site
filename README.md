## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Branding
Edit `data/branding.json` - this file now follows the HERE AND NOW AI structure:
```json
{
  "brand": {
    "organizationName": "HERE AND NOW AI",
    "slogan": "designed with passion for innovation",
    "logo": {
      "title": "logo-url",
      "favicon": "favicon-url"
    },
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#FFDF00",
      "secondary": "#004040"
    }
  }
}
```

### Updating Theme
Modify `data/theme.json`:
```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#your-color",
    "accent": "#your-accent"
  }
}
```

### Adding Games
Update `data/games.json`:
```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "name": "Your Game",
      "description": "Game description",
      "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
      "category": "Memory|Educational|etc"
    }
  ]
}
```
